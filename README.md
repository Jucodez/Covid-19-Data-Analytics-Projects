# Covid 19 Data Analytics Project


## Introduction

This data analytics project aims to gain more insight into the COVID-19 pandemic from inception till the present date (2021-04-30). Using Covid 19 data from [ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), various questions about the pandemic would be answered using SQL to query the data.

## Solution

1. What is the possibility of dying from COVID in your country (death rate)?

            SELECT
                  location,
                  date,
                  total_cases,
                  total_deaths,
                  ROUND(((total_deaths/total_cases)*100),2) AS [death_rate(%)]
            FROM CovidDeaths
            WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
            ORDER BY location, date DESC;

2. What is the present likelihood of dying if you contract COVID-19 in your country (present death rate)?

            SELECT
                  location,
                  MAX(total_cases) AS present_total_cases,
                  MAX(total_deaths) AS present_total_deaths,
                  ROUND((MAX(total_deaths)/MAX(total_cases)*100),5) AS [present_death_rate(%)]
            FROM CovidDeaths
            WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
            GROUP BY location
            ORDER BY [present_death_rate(%)] DESC;

4. For each country, what percentage of the population has been killed by the pandemic?

            SELECT
                  location,
                  population,

Another approach.

                  AND death.date = vaccine.date
            WHERE death.continent IS NOT NULL
            )
            SELECT
                  location,
                  MAX(date) AS date,
                  population,
                  MAX(rolling_people_vaccination) AS present_number_vaccinated,
                  ROUND((MAX(rolling_people_vaccination)/population)*100,4) AS vaccination_rate
            FROM vac
            GROUP BY location, population
            ORDER BY location;


12. What portion of the population tested for each country (using temp tables)?

            DROP TABLE IF EXISTS #PopulationTested;
            CREATE TABLE #PopulationTested (
                  location NVARCHAR(255),
                  date DATETIME,
                  population BIGINT,
                  new_tests INT,
                  total_people_tested INT
                  );

            INSERT INTO #PopulationTested
            SELECT
                  death.location,
                  death.date,
                  death.population,
                  vaccine.new_tests,
                  vaccine.total_tests
            FROM CovidDeaths death
            JOIN CovidVaccinations vaccine
                  ON death.location = vaccine.location
                  AND death.date = vaccine.date
            WHERE death.continent IS NOT NULL;

            SELECT
                  location,
                  MAX(date) AS date,
                  population,
                  MAX(total_people_tested) AS present_number_tested,
                  ROUND((MAX(CAST(total_people_tested AS FLOAT))/population)*100,4) AS [testing_rate(%)]
            FROM #PopulationTested
            GROUP BY location, population
            ORDER BY location;
